description: 'Building towards our key scripture in 1 Cor 3:11, Paul come to the church
  in Corinth to comfort, challenge and correct them. He remind them nothing is being
  withheld, but their maturity is in question and therefore they are lacking application.
  So much available to us as believers in Christ, knowing the depth of God - because
  we have the Holy Spirit living us, the Spirit of God. We get to choose our rate
  of maturity, depending on how we engage with grace and truth. '
