scripture: 1 Corinthians 2:11-16
description: 'This week we continue with 1 Corinthians 2. Received here is one of
  the key words in this passage. Received with initiative, a responsibility to activate
  what has been given. This is Paul’s reminder to us. Why do we not make use of what
  Jesus had given to us? Our ability to “appraise, judge” things is a result of laying
  hold of what we have been given. Those who lay hold are those who choose to live
  as who they really are; new creation, spiritual person. '
