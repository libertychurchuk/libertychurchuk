title: When You See Him Part 2
scripture: 2 Tim. 3:14-15; Heb. 5:12-14; 1Tim 4:7-9
description: "An important element of the study of the Word is, the Word grant you
  2 things:\n\nKnowledge - I know, I know I’m born again, I’m a son/daughter of God
  etc.\n\nSkillfulness - a function of consistent exposure to the knowledge. Paul
  in 2Tim 3:14 told Timothy “To continue”. Continue here meaning to “dwell” “abide”,
  to be steadfast at something and to be consistent at it. \n\nThat consistency grants
  you a skill. Skilful meaning to relate with the Word from a more experiential point
  of view. UnSkilful meaning by not exercising yourself. Heb. 5:12-14."
