title: He Who Upholds Everything - Part 2
scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:11
description: 'Whether we look up at the night sky and observe the universe in all
  its splendour. Take notice of the mountains, hills and fields that surround us and
  marvel at their forms and colours. Or look into the eyes of someone we love and
  imagine the depth of complexity that goes into producing such a wondrous and beautiful
  creation. Do we ever stop to consider what and who underpins every molecule that
  goes towards holding everything that we can see together. In this message we are
  going to look at Jesus, the Alpha and the Omega, the Rock of our salvation upon
  which all that was made exists, rests and is built upon. '
