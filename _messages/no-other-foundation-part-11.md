title: No Other Foundation
scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:1-15
description: 'Paul reminds us that we have the mind of Christ and the Holy Spirit
  livening in us. We are Gods field and His building. There is a grace upon each of
  us to build, be, walk in all Jesus has for us. You and me are a gift to one another.
  We are best when we truly partner together. Partnership is the key thought as we
  unpack this passage, biblical, real, invested partnership. And all can only be built
  on a solid sure foundation, no other than Jesus. '
