scripture: Luke 1
description: "It can be easy to look at the future with rose-colored glasses. After
  all, everything is better in the future. You have a deeper relationship with God
  in the future. You are a better spouse in the future. Youâ€™re a better parent in
  the future. And that can be true!\n\nHowever, these things do not just happen. There
  are decisions that undergird their success.  \n\nThe secret of your becoming or
  unbecoming is in your DAILY ROUTINES."
