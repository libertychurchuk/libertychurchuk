title: My heart, His design
scripture: Proverbs 23:26, Proverbs 3:5-6, Ephesians 2:10, John 17:8
description: 'Gods heart for His church is family, a people on a mission, who are
  His disciples growing, influencing and reproducing themselves. Seems so simple!
  We discuss what are the obstacles to this picture of simplicity. Maybe the one major
  problem, is TRUST. Do we actually trust God, truth people. Trust involves our heart.
  But we are so risk adverse as a generation, that we protect or control. What would
  it look like to RISK It is God? To know that our capacity is only as much as our
  deepest wound. Will Jesus really meet me in that space, so that I can begin to Trust
  again and live in the simplicity of the Gospel. '
