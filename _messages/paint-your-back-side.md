title: Paint Your Back Side!
series: _series/rebuild-restore-renew.md
scripture: 1 Samuel 16:7
description: It’s so important that we look after our hearts. Often our world tells
  us to concentrate on what the outside looks like, but God doesn’t look at the outside
  appearance. Remember to treat the ‘back side’ of your life and allow God to do a
  work in the secret places in you.
