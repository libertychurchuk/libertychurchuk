description: |-
  Has the present day church lost sight of what making disciples
  involves and looks like?

  Do we truly understand what it means to be a biblical, Christ
  following disciple ourselves?

  During this message we will endeavour to briefly look at the two
  fold aspects of the mission of the Messiah as prophesied by Isaiah
  in Chapter 61:1-4, fulfilled in Christ in Luke 4:18 and its
  continuation with the great commissioning of the church in
  Matthew 28 and Mark 16. Then from these chapters and verses,
  compare the condition and beliefs of the present day church.
