scripture: Phil. 3:1-8; Romans 1:21; Acts 16:16-34
description: "When Paul SAW HIM, He said: \n“I count ALL THINGS loss for the excellence
  of the knowledge of Christ Jesus… and I count them as rubbish, that I may GAIN Christ
  - Phil. 3:1-8. \nIt’s not enough to see/know God, but give Him His place in every
  area of your life and circumstance accordingly. By glorifying Him for who He is,
  not just for what he can do or will do."
