title: Family Meeting
scripture: Romans 12:4-8 Ephesians 2:19-22
description: Recognising that it is Jesus who builds the church and we are invited
  in to family. Family looks different and we often have different roles and seasons
  but we are still part of the family. God has given us gifts and passions and they
  are for His glory. It is not about just fulfilling function but recognising we have
  a place and a space in the family.
