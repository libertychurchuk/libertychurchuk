title: Which S(s)pirit
scripture: Deuteronomy 8:6-18
description: Which spirit is going to be the overwhelming voice into our lives as
  believers and therefore into the life of the church? How do we guard against the
  patterns ands rhythms of this world in order to walk in the ways of God. The subtlety
  that the enemy uses in order to distract us from a life of joy and delight. I hope
  this podcast helps you to begin to ask the right questions for you and your family
  so that you give thought to what or who is actually directing you?
