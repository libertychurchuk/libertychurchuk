description: We learn to trust Gods voice in the place of restricted site ‘wadi’.
  When the sense of being overwhelmed is present, it is ok to just know the next step.
  Sometimes we don’t see the whole journey. Trusting the Story and who God is, knowing
  that He will bring us to oasis of life ‘En Gendi’s'. As we come to these places,
  we not only receive but realise we are called as His people to be those rivers and
  oasis of life for others. We can only distribute what we contain.
