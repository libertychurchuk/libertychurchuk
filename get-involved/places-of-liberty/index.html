  description: <p>Back at the start of Liberty Church being birthed, a prophetic word
    was spoken into out house around 'Places of Liberty'.</p><p>Alongside our "Sunday
    expression", we have 'Places of Liberty' in the form of small groups taking places
    all over our city and further! They are a great place to build friendships, grow
    in faith, be involved in the life of the church and also invite friends to!</p>

  content: "<p><strong>So how do the groups run?</strong></p><p>Our groups run in
    ‘terms’ throughout the year (Sept-Nov, Jan-April, May-July) for approx. 10 consecutive
    weeks. Each term may have similar groups runnings or completely new ones to sign
    up to! Our small groups are a great place to build friendships, grow in faith,
    be involved in the life of church and also invite friends to!</p><p><strong>How
    do I choose a group to join?</strong></p><p>You can join a group based on location,
    demographic, focus, day etc. The choice of group </p><p>you join is completely
    up to you! As most of our groups have limited space, we ask that when </p><p>signing
    up for a group you give your 2 preferred options. This means we can make sure
    </p><p>everyone has a group that they can join! </p><p>How do I sign up for a
    group?</p><p>The best way is through our website www.libertychurchuk.com/placesofliberty.
    Alternatively </p><p>you can drop us an email at admin@libertychurchuk.com or
    call 07943 501 007 for more </p><p>information and to sign up.</p><p>Can I attend
    more than one group?</p><p>Yes you can, however we would encourage you to commit
    to one group for the 10 weeks </p><p>rather than attend several occasionally.
    If you are interested in attending more than one, </p><p>please let us know when
    you sign up.</p><p>what happens ater i have sign up?</p><p>Between 20th December
    2020 and 10th January 2021, you have the opportunity to sign</p><p>up to a small
    group. Throughout the 2 weeks after this, leading up to the start of the groups</p><p>you
    will be contacted by your new group leader(s) to welcome you to the group. </p><p>The
    2 weeks, allows us time to adminster all the sign ups and make sure people have
    a group</p><p>to attend for the term.</p>"
