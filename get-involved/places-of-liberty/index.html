  description: <p>Back at the start of Liberty Church being birthed, a prophetic word
    was spoken into out house around 'Places of Liberty'.</p><p>Alongside our "Sunday
    expression", we have 'Places of Liberty' in the form of small groups taking places
    all over our city and further! They are a great place to build friendships, grow
    in faith, be involved in the life of the church and also invite friends to!</p>

  content: "<p><strong>So how do the groups run?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Our groups
    run in ‘terms’ throughout the year (Sept-Nov, Jan-April, May-July) for approx.
    10 consecutive weeks. Each term may have similar groups running or completely
    new ones to sign up to! Our small groups are a great place to build friendships,
    grow in faith, be involved in the life of church and also invite friends to!</p></blockquote><p><strong>How
    do I choose a group to join?</strong></p><blockquote><p>You can join a group based
    on location, demographic, focus, day etc. The choice of group you join is completely
    up to you! As most of our groups have limited space, we ask that when signing
    up for a group you give your 2 preferred options. This means we can make sure
    everyone has a group that they can join! </p></blockquote><p><strong>How do I
    sign up for a group?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The best way is through our website
    www.libertychurchuk.com/placesofliberty. Alternatively you can drop us an email
    at admin@libertychurchuk.com or call 07943 501 007 for more information and to
    sign up.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Can I attend more than one group?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes
    you can, however we would encourage you to commit to one group for the 10 weeks
    rather than attend several occasionally. If you are interested in attending more
    than one, please let us know when you sign up.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What
    happens after I have signed up?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Between 25th April
    and 9th May 2021, you have the opportunity to sign up to a small group. Throughout
    the following week, leading up to the start of the groups, you will be contacted
    by your new group leader(s) to welcome you to the group. This week allows us time
    to administer all the sign ups and make sure people have a group to attend for
    the term.</p></blockquote>"
