  description: <p>Back at the start of Liberty Church being birthed, a prophetic word
    was spoken into out house around 'Places of Liberty'. We are excited for those
    to become a reality as we step into a new season.</p><p>Alongside our "Sunday
    expression", from October 2020 we will be launching new 'Places of Liberty' in
    the form of small groups and we are so excited for you to be part of them! These
    will be a great place to build friendships, grow in faith, be involved in the
    life of the church and also invite friends to!</p>
