  description: <p>Back at the start of Liberty Church being birthed, a prophetic word
    was spoken into out house around 'Places of Liberty'.</p><p>Alongside our "Sunday
    expression", we have 'Places of Liberty' in the form of small groups taking places
    all over our city and further! They are a great place to build friendships, grow
    in faith, be involved in the life of the church and also invite friends to!</p>
