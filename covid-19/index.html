We are excited to bring you this information and encourage you to thank Jesus for His goodness and kindness this season. We together are a people full of faith and full of the Holy Spirit who are adaptable and flexible to not let circumstances be the biggest voice, but rather allow Jesus to be glorified through this season.

Here are some practical changes which we are putting in place to help. 

We want to remind you that you are free and powerful people who are able to make choices and know that we will support you in your decisions, understanding that circumstances are different for every individual and family. 

We are continuing to monitor [government guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response) on how people can gather.

Whatever we decide to do as a church, I am sure there will be some who agree and some who criticise. Please understand we have never led through a situation like this and our hearts desire is to look after you well and also hear the voice of God above the voice of Coronavirus in this. 

If you decide to visit someone or attend one of the provisions, please understand this is your choice. We love you and want to support you in your decisions.
If you need something at this time, are worried and concerned or maybe you have an idea on how to help people, we are available to be contacted.
