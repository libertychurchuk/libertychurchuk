  Meeting on Monday evenings focusing on the Care for the Family Course: Time out for parents - children with additional needs.

  These evenings provide an opportunity to support and encourage each other as parents. They aim to help support you in meeting your childâ€™s needs, focussing on children aged between 3 to 11 years with a disability or additional needs, particularly those who have learning, developmental and behavioural issues.

  This group could also be an ideal opportunity to invite someone along with you. We look forward to spending time together.
