title: Keys to Freedom
leaders: Rob & Christine McFarlane
description: "<p>Keys to Freedom, from Mercy UK,  is an eight week interactive </p><p>course
  that provides opportunity to learn the tools that God has </p><p>made available
  to us through a relationship with Jesus Christ. It takes </p><p>biblical principles
  and applies them to our lives to enable us to </p><p>navigate our way into a place
  of freedom, wholeness and transformation.</p><p> </p><p>This course does not bring
  instant answers or a formula to follow that </p><p>guarantees a trouble free life
  but it will empower and inspire you with </p><p>hope. The keys to freedom that we
  will unpack together during this </p><p>nine week journey will educate, equip and
  empower you with tools </p><p>that, should you continue to use them, will bring
  lasting change and </p><p>breakthrough.</p><p> </p><p>The principles or keys that
  we will explore are:</p><p> </p><p>- Recognising the voice of God</p><p>- Committing
  and connecting fully to Christ</p><p>- Renewing your mind</p><p>- Choosing to forgive</p><p>-
  Healing life’s hurts</p><p>- Breaking generational patterns</p><p>- Using your authority
  in Christ</p><p>- Maintaining lifelong freedom</p><p> </p><p>We will focus on one
  chapter each week, with 5 days of study and there </p><p>will need to be some time
  set aside (perhaps 20-25 mins each day) </p><p>where you will study each key. You
  will be asked to look up passages </p><p>in the Bible and challenged to apply the
  principles to your own life, </p><p>with the opportunity to reflect and journal
  your responses as you go </p><p>along.</p><p> </p><p>We will meet each week to review
  the chapter and encourage one </p><p>another in the journey. We ask you to commit
  to the full 9 weeks.</p><p> </p><p>If you are interested in signing up for the course
  but have further </p><p>questions, please drop us an email to admin@libertychurchuk.com</p><p>
  </p><p>(You will be required to purchase your own workbook. Cost : £8.00)</p>"
