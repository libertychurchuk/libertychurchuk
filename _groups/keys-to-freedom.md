leaders: David Barclay
description: "<p>This group is all about stepping out! On a Sunday afternoon we will
  be meeting in Newport town centre to pray and talk around some of the examples where
  people have stepped out in the Bible. We will then spend some walking the streets
  discussing what we have talked about and trusting the Holy Spirit to direct us as
  we have conversations with people we meet. Itâ€™s all about being available for God
  to use us and stepping out!</p>"
