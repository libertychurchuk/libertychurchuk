title: Keys to Freedom
leaders: Rob & Christine McFarlane
description: "<p>Keys to Freedom, from Mercy UK, is an nine week interactive course
  that provides opportunity to learn the tools that God has made available to us through
  a relationship with Jesus Christ. It takes Biblical principles and applies them
  to our live to enable us to navigate our way into a place of freedom, wholeness
  and transformation.</p><p>The course does not bring instant answers or a formula
  to follow that guarantees a trouble free life but it will empower and inspire you
  with hope. The keys to freedom that we will unpack together during this nine week
  journey will educate, equip and empower you with tools that should you continue
  to use them, will bring lasting change and breakthrough.</p><p>The principles or
  keys that we will explore are:</p><ul><li><p>Recognising the voice of God</p></li><li><p>Committing
  and connecting fully to Christ</p></li><li><p>Renewing your mind</p></li><li><p>Choosing
  to forgive</p></li><li><p>Healing life's hurts</p></li><li><p>Breaking generational
  patterns</p></li><li><p>Using your authority in Christ</p></li><li><p>Maintaining
  lifelong freedom</p></li></ul><p>We will focus on one chapter each week, with 5
  days of study and there will need to be some time set aside (perhaps 20-25mins each
  day) where you will study each key. You will be asked to look up passages in the
  Bible and challenged to apply the principles to your own life, with the opportunity
  to reflect and journal your responses as you go along.</p><p>We will meet each week
  to review the chapter and encourage one another in the journey. We ask you to commit
  to the full 9 weeks.</p><p>If you are interest in signing up for the course but
  have further questions, please drop us an email to admin@libertychurchuk.com</p><p>(You
  will be required to purchase your own workbook at Â£8.00)</p>"
