location: St Julians
description: We are a group of older followers of Jesus who seek to glorify Him in
  our fellowship together. We want to encourage one another to worship, pray, read, serve
  and sow into Godâ€™s Kingdom. We engage in more sedate social activities to suit children
  of the sixties and seventies!
