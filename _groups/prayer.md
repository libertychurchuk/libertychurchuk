leaders: Rob McFarlane & Graeme De Villiers
description: "<p>These evenings will be focused on John’s teaching in the Bible on
  the ‘Revelation of Jesus Christ’, that there is no new revelation in the final book
  of the Bible, rather that it pulls everything together from Genesis to Jude, and
  most practically how this points to how we should be living our lives today. </p><p>We
  will have a time of teaching and open question/discussion time. We would love you
  to join us!</p>"
