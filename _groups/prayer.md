description: <p>"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" Psalm
  11:3</p><p>Our continual triumph in our Christian walk or journey is ultimately
  based on the solid foundation laid by Christ, which is seen through God's Character,
  His Word and the believers identity.</p><p>In the prayer small group, we will be
  focusing on these three key subjects which I call the 3 H's of prayer:</p><ul><li><p>His
  Character</p></li><li><p>His Word</p></li><li><p>Him in us (Our identity in Him)</p></li></ul><p>(After
  the small group we will be joining together with others to pray together from 8-9pm
  at the Gaer CC)</p><p>We would love to see you there!</p>
