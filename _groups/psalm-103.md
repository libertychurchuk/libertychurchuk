leaders: Adam & Lizzy Howard
description: "<p>If you have a heart for worship and a desire for community then why
  not come along to our worship Team Nights every Thursday evening. Maybe you have
  been playing guitar in your bedroom or singing in the shower but want to take the
  next step. Perhaps you are interested in sound design or want to serve on our visual
  team, come along and we would love to help you find your space within our team.
  You donâ€™t need to be Mozart or Jimi Hendrix, but a degree of instrumental capability
  would be preferable, for all other elements such as words and sound, training will
  be provided.</p><p>We would love for you to become part of our worship family.</p>"
