  content: "<p><strong><em>Genesis Collective... A collective of churches and relationships
    committed to global church planting, together.</em></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Making
    Sense of It All</strong></p><p>We want to invite you and your leadership team,
    to join with us in the beautiful nation of Wales for 3 days in what we believe
    and know will be a significant time of input. God is inviting each of us to pause,
    dwell and connect with Him in what has been an unknown and unfolding season.</p><p>How
    do we be kind to ourselves as leaders, taking the time to make sense of what we
    journey through and bring life and hope to those we lead.</p><p>In reality we
    are not always able to make sense of everything, but we can together hold on to
    the mysteries of the Faith, knowing that in relationship and friendship we are
    able to journey and navigate all that lies ahead for us.</p><p>We look forward
    to this time together as we worship, hear God's Word, encourage, edify and have
    fun. A great opportunity to meet and build new friendships. We canâ€™t wait to see
    you there.</p><p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p><p>Tuesday 15th February - Global
    Leadership Day (Invite Only)</p><p>Wednesday 16th - Friday 18th February - Main
    Conference</p>"
