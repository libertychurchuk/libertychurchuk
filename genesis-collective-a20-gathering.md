  of churches and relationships committed to global church planting, together.</p><p></p><p><strong>Making
  Sense of It All</strong></p><p>We want to invite you and your leadership team, to
  join with us in the beautiful nation of Wales for 3 days in what we believe and
  know will be a significant time of input. God is inviting each of us to pause, dwell
  and connect with Him in what has been an unknown and unfolding season.</p><p>How
  do we be kind to ourselves as leaders, taking the time to make sense of what we
  journey through and bring life and hope to those we lead.</p><p>In reality we are
  not always able to make sense of everything, but we can together hold on to the
  mysteries of the Faith, knowing that in relationship and friendship we are able
  to journey and navigate all that lies ahead for us.</p><p>We look forward to this
  time together as we worship, hear God's Word, encourage, edify and have fun. A great
  opportunity to meet and build new friendships. We canâ€™t wait to see you there.</p><p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p><p>Tuesday
  15th February - Global Leadership Day (Invite Only)</p><p>Wednesday 16th - Friday
  18th February - Main Conference</p>"
