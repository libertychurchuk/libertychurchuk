Sometimes life is rough  
Situations can be tough  
When I can see no way through  
I know, I can trust You  

So I walk by faith and not by sight  
‘Cos I know You’ll lead me with Your light  
When things go wrong and life seems dark  
You said we’ll never be apart  

You said You’ll never leave me  
And I know You’re a man of Your word  
Jesus, always beside me  
Helping to show me the way I should live  

So I walk by faith and not by sight  
I’ll take each step by faith and not by sight
