_Original Key â€“ D // 115BPM_

In every season of my soul  
I will cling to this one hope  
That great, your faithfulness remains  
And steadfast still, my anchor holds  

And even in the valley deep  
Where shadows form and storm winds blow  
The promise in my heart stands firm  
That you are never letting go  

My rock and my salvation, You will be  
Beneath your mighty wings, You shelter me  
My help in times of need, I lift my eyes  
You will see me through, O God, my Light  

And standing on the mountain high  
Where troubles seem so far behind  
In all my days I'll lift Your name  
'Cos in every season, You're the same   

As we approach the final day  
When all the pain has passed away  
Forever let our praises ring  
To our Glorious, reigning, risen King
