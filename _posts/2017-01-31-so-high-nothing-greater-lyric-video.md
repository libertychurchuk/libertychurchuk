So high, you cant get over it  
So deep, you cant get under it  
So wide, there’s no way round it  
His love, His love.  
So big, He’s bigger than my fear  
So close, He’s promised to be near  
There’s nothing greater than His love, His love.  

How wide, how high, how long, how deep  
Is my Saviour’s love.  
There is no way,  
No, not one thing  
To keep me from His love **(x2)**   
How wonderful, it’s super good  
It blows my mind away!  

So good, it’s better than TV  
I know, He’s watching over me  
It’s true, there’s nothing like His love, His love.  
I know my future has a plan  
‘Cos my name is written on His hands  
There’s nothing better than His love, His love.  

Whoa, there’s nothing greater, nothing greater  
Whoa, there’s nothing greater, nothing greater  
Whoa, there’s nothing greater than the love of God.
