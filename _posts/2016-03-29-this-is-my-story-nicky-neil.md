My story started in South Africa where I was born and church has been a massive part of my life right from the beginning. We moved to South Wales as a family when I was six, after my father died in a car accident. This is where my walk with God really began, I became baptised in water at the age of nine, and baptised in the spirit at the age of 10 and God was very real and very active in my life. He gave me words of wisdom and showed me new mercies everyday.

Life went on and I had my ups and downs like everyone else and my relationship with God stayed strong, but although my faith never wavered, over time he no longer reigned supreme in my life. I got swept up with day to day issues allowing my own insecurities and problems to overwhelm me.

At the age of 16 I woke up one day unable to walk. This problem didn't just go away and my life seemed to crumble before my eyes. I was missing school, lost touch with friends and started putting on weight. To cope with lonely bed bound days I started self harming and this quickly became an addition, which even when I was back in school I couldn't overcome alone.

My condition was diagnosed as reflex sympathetic dystrophy an incurable chronic pain condition. This news shattered any hope I had of having a normal future, and I was certain that I was destined to be a victim of life. Perhaps it would be better if I was just dead. I dealt with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for a long time and I no longer felt worthy of Gods love, healing or forgiveness.

He never gave up on me however and his hand stayed firmly on my life, because although I may not have believed it myself he knew I was special He knew he had a plan and purpose for my life. And thank God he never puts us through situations he knows we can't handle.

God saw me safely through my depression and I stoped self harming in September 2013 I have never looked back since. Life really started looking up and university was going well, it was coming up to the end of my second year when I found out I was pregnant, due to give birth in only three months. God managed to use this situation for his own agenda. I was blessed with a beautiful baby boy who gave me purpose, motivation and most importantly gave me a glimpse of the ever growing love that God has for each and everyone of us.

I know Robbie has been placed on this earth for a reason. God has great purpose for his life as well as mine, and I am ever thankful for what initially seemed to be a dark situation being able to become something wonderful. Since having Robbie my relationship with God has become stronger, I have learnt that I can hand any situation over to him and no matter how dark they might seem, He will show me the light and He will help me through life, He is on my side and he wants me to succeed.

In 2015 I received prayer for healing as my condition had worsened. I was really struggling with Robbie now being mobile. By the grace of God my incurable condition finally had a cure and His name is Jesus Christ. This healing has completely changed my life, being able to get around and become active again has aided me in loosing 70 pounds and drop from a dress size 22 to a 14. I'm able to walk run and drive, and I can even wear shoes and socks again, something I've not been able to do for six years.

Most importantly I have learnt that God is on my side, He wants to help me, He wants to be there for me, and He wants to cheer me on when I succeed. I can well and truly say that I owe my life to Him and although my life is flawed an not nearly good enough to offer, thank God he has accepted it.

In 2015 I was given a prophetic word to be content with my life as it was. And although it seemed dull I believe it was very important for me to rest, be comfortable and learn to enjoy the small things that God shows us.

At the end of 2015 I found Liberty Church, and in the time I have been coming here I felt loved and welcomed by everyone. I believe that for 2016 the word God has for me is to expect, i'm expecting my relationship to grow with God this year and for Him to use me in ways I've never imagined before.
