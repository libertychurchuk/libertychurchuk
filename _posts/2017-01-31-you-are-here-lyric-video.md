_Original Key – E // 160BPM_

You are here  
There is no fear in Your presence.  
You are here  
You’re my peace and my fortress.  

Where the Spirit is  
There is freedom  
Where the Spirit is  
There is freedom  

You are here  
Come refresh and revive me You are here  
Come breathe life and ignite me  

No condemnation  
No longer bound  
No more confusion  
In truth, I’m found  
And as sons and daughters In Christ we’re free  
To live in freedom  
We the redeemed
