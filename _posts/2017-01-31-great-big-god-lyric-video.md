He is a great big God  
He’s looking out for us  
He’s watching over us  
Each and every day  
He is a great big God  
Higher than the highest tree  
Wider than the widest sea  
And stronger than my dad  
He is a great big God  
And He loves me just the way I am.  

He’s bigger than the whole wide world  
He’s higher than the sky  
He’s stronger than superman  
And He loves you and I  

And we will clap, clap, clap, clap our hands  
And we will jump, jump, jump, jump around  
And we will stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp our feet  
And we will shake, shake, shake, shake it out
