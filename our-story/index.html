  subtitle: " Where it all started"
  description: "<p>After our launch night at The Lysaght Institute, we moved to Hatherleigh
    Community Centre in February 2015 and made this our first home.</p><p>The centre
    is right in the heart of the community and we developed some great relationships
    there. This home was a place of firsts. We celebrated Easter, Mother’s Day, and
    ran Messy Church to name a few!</p><p>In 2015 we launched Liberty Groups, a place
    where people can meet in homes across our city, be discipled and do life together.
    Since moving on from the Hatherleigh Community Centre, we have continued our relationship
    and presence there with our Liberty Lambs (Parent &amp; Toddler) provision.</p>"
