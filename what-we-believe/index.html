      The Church and Christian Living
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>We believe that the true church comprises all who have been justified by God’s grace through faith alone in Christ alone. They are united by the Holy Spirit in the body of Christ, of which He is the Head.</p>

      <p>The true church is manifest in local churches, whose membership should be composed only of believers. That local church should seek to model, in every way, the pattern of the New Testament example of Christian life, values, structure and power.</p>

      <p>We believe the Lord Jesus mandated two ordinances, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.</p>

      <p>We believe in the power and significance of the Church and the necessity of believers to meet regularly together for fellowship, prayer and communion. We believe that God has individually equipped us so that we can successfully achieve His purpose for our lives which is to worship God, fulfil our role in the Church and serve the community in which we live. </p>

      <p>We believe that God wants to heal and transform us so that we can live healthy and blessed lives in order to help others more effectively.</p>

      <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again as He promised.</p>

      How we Govern
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>Liberty is an autonomous local church led by a team of elders who, under Jesus Christ the head of the church, carry final responsibility for governmental aspects of church life.</p>

      <p>The eldership team consists of men who qualify biblically according to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+3&version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">1 Timothy 3</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1&version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Titus 1</a> and have been called by Christ. New elders are proposed by the existing eldership team but are ordained, set into the office, by an apostle (Acts 14:23) or an apostle’s delegate <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1%3A5&version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Titus 1:5</a>. The eldership team, like any other team, has a leader whom we refer to as the lead elder. A good way of explaining the reason for and the limitations of this role is to say that the lead elder leads the eldership team which leads the church.</p>

      <p>Elder, pastor and overseer are terms that are used interchangeably in scripture to describe different aspects of the role of eldership. ‘Elder’ refers to the biblical office these men occupy, while the verb pastor, (literally “to shepherd”), describes their spiritual role. ‘Overseer’ refers to the functional role of “directing the affairs of the local church”, and includes responsibility for direction, doctrine and discipline in the local church. Part of that responsibility includes financial oversight of the church. Financial integrity of the church is safeguarded through a thorough segregation of financial duties and an annual review of our financial records by external auditors.</p>
