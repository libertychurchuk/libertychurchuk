## Job 22:22-25 (NIV)

Accept instruction from his mouth  
 and lay up his words in your heart.  
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored:  
 If you remove wickedness far from your tent  
and assign your nuggets to the dust,  
 your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,  
then the Almighty will be your gold,  
 the choicest silver for you.

## Psalm 63:1-2 (NIV)

You, God, are my God,  
 earnestly I seek you;  
I thirst for you,  
 my whole being longs for you,  
in a dry and parched land  
 where there is no water.

I have seen you in the sanctuary  
 and beheld your power and your glory.
