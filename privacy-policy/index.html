<ul>
<li>We feel there is a legitimate interest for us to do so.</li>
<li>It is necessary for law enforcement or similar purposes.</li>

<p>As an individual, you have control over what information we hold about you, how it is used, and whether you are happy for us to keep it. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that you have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Right to be informed</strong> — to know what information we collect about you and why. This policy is in response to this right.</li>
<li><strong>Right of access</strong> — to see what information we hold about you and to verify the lawfulness of our processing of your data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — to ask us to change or complete any inaccurate or incomplete personal information held about you.</li>
<li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> — to ask us to delete your personal information where it is no longer necessary for us to use it, you have withdrawn consent, or where we have no lawful basis for keeping it.</li>
<li><strong>Right to restrict processing</strong> — to change the way in which we use your data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> — to provide you or a third party with some of the personal information that we hold about you in a structured, commonly used, electronic form, so it can be easily transferred.</li>
<li><strong>Right to object</strong> — to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.</li>
<li><strong>Right not to be subjected to automatic decision making including profiling</strong> — You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions that will create legal effects or have a similar significant impact on you, unless you have given us your consent. We do not currently carry out any automated decision-making.</li>
