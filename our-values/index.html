      God is good
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>At Liberty church we believe that the fundamental nature of God is that He is good. Jesus Himself being the express image of the Father, revealed to us God’s nature and desire for mankind as He walked this earth as Jesus went about doing GOOD and healing all who were oppressed by the devil. Through the prophet Jeremiah we hear God’s very own words as He declares, “My thoughts towards you are for GOOD (Shalom) and not for evil”. Also in James we read that every GOOD gift comes down from Him and there is no variation or change of heart in His desire for us. He can not tempt anyone to do what is not good neither can He himself be tempted to do what is not good. That He is light and in Him there is no darkness. Even our very own salvation is as a result of the GOODNESS and kindness of God.</p>

      Jesus has come to set us free
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>We believe the bible reveals clearly that the heart of God for mankind is total freedom through salvation and new birth. It tells us that from the time of Adams fall, mankind has been subjected to slavery to sin, Satan and self. Through the power of sin, Satan has been able to enslave and control mankind through their own selfish desires. However, Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil and set mankind free from the power of sin, Satan and self. Jesus Himself declared the heart of God for mankind when saying “The thief has come to steal, kill and destroy, BUT I have come that you may have life, and have it in abundance”. He also went on to say that “We will know the truth and the truth will set us free”.</p>

      God’s Word transforms
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>We believe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation. That ALL scripture is God breathed, given by inspiration of The Holy Spirit and is profitable for conformity to God’s will and purpose in every area of our lives. We believe that true transformation only comes by the renewing of the mind, the implanting of God’s word into our hearts and the exercising of our faith in God’s word through our own words and deeds. We are dedicated to helping every believer grow in their knowledge of God’s word by learning how to study, meditate upon, teach and live according to God’s word, by providing adequate, available resources and opportunities to grow and develop both in gift and character and applying what is learnt through selflessness, servanthood and generosity of spirit.

      God still speaks
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>Jesus said “My sheep hear My voice” and promised us that He would send us another comforter, The Holy Spirit, who would “teach us all things”. At Liberty church we believe that God, by His Holy Spirit, primarily through His word, His people, His Spiritual gifts to the body and various other ways that He chooses, such as dreams, visions and even through the creation itself, still speaks to mankind. Proverbs declares that His wisdom cries out when we are faced with many paths to take and His still small voice can be heard even in the midst of the storms of life. Therefore we at Liberty believe in the necessity of taking and making time to listen for His voice in a spirit of humble submission.</p>

      This is His Church
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>At Liberty church we believe that each believer is a member of the body of Christ, Jesus being the head of that body. Jesus paid the price for His church, died for His church and is coming back for His church. It is our belief that though we all have the privilege to be ministers within the body of Christ, it is still Jesus who is the Head and He is the one who is in charge of building His church. Under His guidance and the empowerment of His Spirit we endeavour to see His church glorified and beautified according to the image of Him who created it. </p>

      A devoted people
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>Love, loyalty and enthusiasm for the Lord, His people and His cause would be an accurate description of the early church believers. It is our aim to create a culture of devotion amongst the Lords’ people that reflects the culture of the early church in the book of Acts, where “they devoted themselves”.  At Liberty church we believe that God revealed His devotion to us through the incredible selfless act of giving us His Son Jesus along with the multitude of His promises to provide for our every need. We believe that our only reasonable response to this amazing truth should be nothing less than our devotion to Him. </p>

      We are free and powerful people
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>We believe that every individual has been created for a purpose, equipped and empowered by God to fulfil that purpose and has been given the incredible gift of free will to choose to, or not to choose to carry out that purpose. It is the driving, unflinching desire of Liberty church to help every child of God to become all that they have been born to be and achieve all they have been born to do, through liberating biblical teaching, loving pastoral support and the living examples of God centred leadership.

      A generous people
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>"For God so loved the world that He gave”. There is no one more generous than our God. At Liberty church we believe that a true sign of spiritual maturity is generosity of spirit motivated by a deep abiding thankfulness to God for His limitless, abounding and ever faithful goodness. The giving of time, resources, finances, gifting and talents or any other personal sacrifices made for the benefit of others is a hallmark value of the Kingdom of God. Jesus Himself came not to be served but to serve. He gave all that He had, even His own life, for the benefit of us all. We at Liberty encourage such actions to be applied not only within the body of Christ, but also towards the searching people of the world around us, as a witness for Jesus, as God’s people are moved by the Spirit in areas of selfless generosity.

    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>We believe that all people are created equal in the sight of God, therefore all people deserve honour irrespective of age, race, gender or status.</p>
        <p>At Liberty church we are not only a congregation that honours leadership but also a leadership that honours the congregation. A people who believe in living with an attitude of honour regarding moral issues. That is being honorable as a quality of knowing and doing what is morally right.</p>

      Healthy people, healthy families, healthy communities, healthy cities 
    </h2>
    <div class="js-accordion__panel">
      <p>At Liberty church we believe that in order to change our cities we need to allow God to change us first. Our aim is to help people prosper on their journey of discipleship in all areas of the human makeup. We believe that God is committed to the health of every individual in spirit, soul and body and this is the foundation for building healthy relationships. Healthy people help build healthy relationships, healthy relationships help build healthy families, healthy families help build healthy communities, healthy communities help build healthy cities.
