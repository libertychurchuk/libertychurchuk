description: A house of salvation, where disciples are created. A people who are excited
  to share their lives and passion for Jesus with others. An empowering people, who
  build up and edify one another. A pioneering people who occupy their space, their
  street, their world. Who dream, see visions, and believe for the impossible.

            <p>David continued to address Solomon: “Take charge! Take heart! Don’t be anxious or get discouraged. GOD, my God, is with you in this; he won’t walk off and leave you in the lurch. He’s at your side until every last detail is completed for conducting the worship of GOD. You have all the priests and Levites standing ready to pitch in, and skillful craftsmen and artisans of every kind ready to go to work. Both leaders and people are ready. Just say the word.” <em>1 Chronicles 28:20-21 MSG</em></p>
